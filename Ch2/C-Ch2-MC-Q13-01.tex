The next \underline{3} questions  refer to the bond-energy curves in Figure \ref{fig:interatomicseparation} (below) for different two-element materials with the same structure.

\part[2] The material with the \emph{smallest} equilibrium bond energy magnitude ($|E_{0}|$) in Figure \ref{fig:interatomicseparation} is represented by:\\

\begin{choices}
	\correctchoice Curve 1
	\choice Curve 2
	\choice Curve 3
	\choice Curve 4
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
The equilibrium bond energy magnitude is the depth of the well at the equilibrium bond distance. Curve 1.\\

\textbf{Grading:}\\
Only pts for Curve 1.\\

\textbf{F15 Outcome:}\\
A very high percentage of students got this right. If they didn't, they usually misread the problem and selected Curve 4.\\

\end{solution}
