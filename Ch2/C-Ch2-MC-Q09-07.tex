%Begin Question---------------------------------
Two \ce{Na+} and \ce{Cl-} ions are very close to each other (say, $\frac{1}{2}$ the equilibrium bond distance or $\frac{1}{2}r_{\text{0}}$). Which of the following best describes the net force between the ions?:

\begin{choices}
	\choice Attractive, and becomes \emph{more attractive} as they are moved closer.
	\correctchoice Repulsive, and becomes \emph{more repulsive} as they are moved closer.
	\choice Attractive, and becomes \emph{less attractive} as they are moved closer.
	\choice Repulsive, and becomes \emph{less repulsive} as they move closer.
\end{choices}

%Solution-------------------------------------------
\begin{solution}

At short distances --- at interatomic separations smaller than the equilibrium distance --- the repulsive force between two ions dominates due to Pauli repulsion (and nuclear Coulomb repulsion). The net force will then be repulsive. It becomes \emph{even more} repulsive if you try to push them even closer together.

 %Note, if you want to go further mathematically, this can also be deduced from the equations for attractive and repulsive interatomic forces for ions. The $\sim \frac{r}{r^{n}}$ (with $n \sim 8$) in the repulsive force causes the magnitude of that force to increase much more quickly as $r \rightarrow 0$ than the $\sim \frac{1}{r^{2}}$ term in the attractive force does.
	
\end{solution}
