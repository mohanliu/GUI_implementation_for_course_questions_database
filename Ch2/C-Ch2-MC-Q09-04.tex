%Begin Question---------------------------------
SrO and CaO are two ionically bonded materials that possess similar properties. While the attractive energy terms ($E_A$) for both cation-anion pairs are identical, the repulsive terms differ and are provided below:

\begin{center}
	\begin{tabularx}{2.5in}{cc}
	\toprule
	Cation-anion Pair & $E_R$\\
	\midrule
	Ca-O &  $\frac{\unit[3 \times 10^{-6}]{eV \mhyphen nm^8}}{r^8}$ \\
	Sr-O & $\frac{\unit[3 \times 10^{-6}]{eV \mhyphen nm^9}}{r^9}$ \\
	\bottomrule
	\end{tabularx}
\end{center}

From this information, which of the statements regarding melting temperatures ($T_M$) and equilibrium interionic distances ($r_0$) is expected to be true?

\begin{choices}
	\choice $T_M$ of CaO is greater than that of SrO, and $r_0$ for CaO is greater than that of SrO.
	\choice $T_M$ of SrO is greater than that of CaO, and $r_0$ for CaO is greater than that of SrO.
	\correctchoice $T_M$ of CaO is greater than that of SrO, and $r_0$ for SrO is greater than that of CaO.
	\choice $T_M$ of SrO is greater than that of CaO, and $r_0$ for SrO is greater than that of CaO.
\choice CaO and Sro will have the same values for $T_M$ and $r_0$.
\end{choices}

%Solution-------------------------------------------
\begin{solution}

The larger denominator in the repulsive term in the Sr-O pair effectively shifts the net energy curve up in energy and to larger $r$ near $r_0$. Therefore, the melting temperature for the CaO is greater than that of SrO and the $r_0$ distance is greater for the SrO.

%Comments-------------------------------------------------
\begin{comments}

Directly related to C$|$2.19.

W17: Students that missed this (which were few) probably didn't understand what increasing the $n$ in the denominator does.
