\part[2] The material represented by Curve 4 is heated but not melted or sent through a phase transition. The average interatomic separation for the atoms in this material:\\

\begin{choices}
	\choice Decreases to be closer to that of Curve 2
	\choice Stays the same.
	\correctchoice Increases to be closer to that of Curve 3
\end{choices}
\droppoints

\begin{solution}

Heating the material supplies vibrational energy to the system. Because the energy trough is asymmetric, the mean interatomic spacing of the atoms will increase.\\
	
\textbf{Grading:}\\
Only took points for increasing to be closer to that of curve Curve 3.\\
	
\textbf{F15 Outcome:}\\
Only 1-2 out of 80 students missed it.


\end{solution}
