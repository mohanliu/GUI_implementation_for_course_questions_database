\part[2] Which of the materials in Figure \ref{fig:interatomicseparation} has the \emph{smallest} elastic modulus?\\

\begin{choices}
	\correctchoice Curve 1
	\choice Curve 2
	\choice Curve 3
	\choice Curve 4
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}
	A small elastic modulus is indicative of weak bonding in a material. The smallest $|E_{0}|$ belongs to Curve 1 (I think), and it will have the smallest elastic modulus.
	
	In the future, I think I have to be careful, here. $Y = (\frac{d^2E}{dr})_{r_{0}}$, so it should  be the curvature of the function. Pr. Snyder \emph{did} actually show this (L2S32), but the curvatures are difficult to discern by eye. In any case, is best to ask for the \emph{largest} elastic modulus in the future.\\
	
\textbf{Grading:}\\
Points for anything but Curve 4, which has the largest curvature.\\
	
\textbf{F15 Outcome:}\\
Very good, considering I took 3/4 answers. 1-2 out of 80 students missed it.
