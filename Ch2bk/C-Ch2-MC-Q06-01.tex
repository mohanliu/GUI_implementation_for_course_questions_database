%Solution------------------------------------------
\begin{solution}

{\normalsize
Directional bonds are those that possess specific orientations in space.

\begin{itemize}
\item \textbf{Ionic bonds} are derived from electrostatic attraction --- which is non-directional. Imagine two charged oppositely charged ions at some distance $r$ from each other. It doesn't matter \emph{where} in space they are with respect to each other --- the strength of the interaction doesn't change.
\item \textbf{Metallic bonds} are similar and can be described modeled by positive ionic cores sitting within the electron sea. They are non-directional.
\item The way that \textbf{covalent bonds }share valence electrons makes the bonds directional. That is, there exists overlap between specific orbitals ($p$-orbitals, for example) that are directional in nature. If you rotate one atom that is covalently bonded to another, the overlap will change and the bond strength with change.
\item \textbf{Induced-dipole} --- induced-dipole form due to mutual polarization of the electron cloud and are not considered directional.\item \textbf{Hydrogen bonds} are directional because there exists a permanent electronic dipole that has a specific orientation in space.
\end{itemize}
