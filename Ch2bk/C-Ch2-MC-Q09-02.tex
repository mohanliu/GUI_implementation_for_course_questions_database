%Begin Question---------------------------------
At large interatomic separations (say, 10 nm), the net force between a \ce{Na+} ion and a \ce{Cl-} ion is:
\begin{choices}
	\choice Attractive and becomes more attractive as they are moved further apart.
	\choice Repulsive and becomes more repulsive as they are moved further apart.
	\correctchoice Attractive and becomes less attractive as they are moved further apart.
	\choice Repulsive and becomes less repulsive as they move further apart.
\end{choices}

%Solution-------------------------------------------
\begin{solution}

At large distances, the attrative force will dominate to pull the ions together --- there's very little Pauli exclusion going on at 10 nm, so it is all attractive force. As you pull the ions further apart the atractio gets weak, though.


\end{solution}

%Rubric---------------------------------------------------
\begin{rubric}

\begin{itemize}
	\item 50\% pts if they got the answer half correct: e.g., got attractive, but thought they were more repulsive as they are pulled apart.
\end{itemize}
