A material is to be chosen for construction of a pressure vessel. The pressure vessel must be designed so that it will not fail in a brittle manner (i.e. explode) when a crack of a certain length is present in its wall, what is the \textit{most} important material property to consider when selecting a material for its construction?

\begin{choices}
	\choice Yield strength
	\correctchoice Fracture toughness
	\choice Thermal conductivity
	\choice Density
	\choice Price
	\choice Elastic modulus
\end{choices}

\begin{solution}

Although all of these factors may be taken into account in the design of the pressure vessel, the question specifically states that it must not fail in a brittle manner when its wall contains a crack of a certain length.  This is directly related to the fracture toughness.

\end{solution}

\begin{rubric}

50\% pts for yield strength or elastic modulus, as they are important mechanical properties as well. No points for the others, as they are not critical to the application as first-order selection criteria.
